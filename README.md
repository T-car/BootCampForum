## Overview
1. This is a team project that I have worked with five other classmets. The purpose of this website is to provide a Q & A forum for the coding
students of Columbia University.

2. The home page will display the three most recent post and pull a number of technews articles from other platforms via API call

3. Users create a thread and / or add response to someone else's thread.

4. The user authentication is done through AWS Cognito.

5. To improve the response time, we have used Redis to cache the data.
